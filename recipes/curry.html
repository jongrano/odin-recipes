    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a
        boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer
        until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a
        minute or two.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
        Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened
        and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with cumin, cayenne pepper, curry powder, garam masala, ginger,
        and salt; cook for 2 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and potatoes. Pour in the
        coconut milk, and bring to a simmer. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes before
        serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
